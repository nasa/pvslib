# Complex Numbers (Axiomatic)

The complex numbers are defined (axiomatically) in this way so that we can conveniently use the numeric constants 0, 1, 2 etc.
The alternative -- using pairs of reals to represent the real and imaginary components -- would lead to the somewhat unappealing formulation of Euler's result as "exp((0,1)*(pi,0)) = (-1,0)".
As a matter of taste, this formalization allows the somewhat more elegant formulation: "exp(i*pi) = -1".
