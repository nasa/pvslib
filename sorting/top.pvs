%%%%% This library contains verifications of correctness and 
%%%%% completeness of sorting algorithms in PVS using non-interpreted
%%%%% types and an arbitrary pre-order. Course projects on Computational 
%%%%% Logic for undergraduate computer science students have been
%%%%% performed based on sorting algorithms for the type of naturals,
%%%%% and are available at http//logic4cs.cic.unb.br.
%%%%%
%%%%% Popular sorting algorithms as bubblesort, quicksort, 
%%%%% mergesort, insertionsort and sorting by selection of  
%%%%% minimum and switching are verified in this library.
%%%%% Elaboreted sorting algorithms such as Ford-Johnson (merge insertion),
%%%%% heapsort and radix sort are also included. Radix sort is
%%%%% formalized for arbitrary lists of pre-orders and includes also
%%%%% its application to sort naturals.
