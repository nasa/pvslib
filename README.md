NASALib
=

NASALib is a continuing collaborative effort that has spanned over 3 decades,
to aid in research related to theorem proving  sponsored by NASA
(https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/pvs/).
It consists of a collection of formal development (i.e.,
<i>libraries</i>) written in the Prototype Verification System
([PVS](http://pvs.csl.sri.com)), contributed by SRI, NASA, NIA, and the PVS community, and maintained by the
[Formal Methods Team at LaRC](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm).

# Release

# Scripts

NASALib also provides a collection of scripts that automates several tasks.

* [`proveit`](./Scripts.md#proveit) (*) - Runs PVS in batch mode 
* [`provethem`](./Scripts.md#provethem) (*) - Runs `proveit` on several libraries 
* [`pvsio`](./Scripts.md#pvsio) (*) - Command-line utility to run the PVSio ground evaluator.
* [`prove-all`](./Scripts.md#prove-all) - Runs `proveit` on each library
  in NASALib by wrapping `provethem` in order to provide a specific kind of run. 
* [`cleanbin-all`](./Scripts.md#cleanbin-all) - Clean `.pvscontext` and binary files from PVS libraries.
* [`find-all`](./Scripts.md#find-all) - Searches strings matching a given regular expressions in PVS libraries.
* [`dependencygraph`](./Scripts.md#dependencygraph) - Generates a library dependency graph for libraries in the current directory.
* [`dependency-all`](./Scripts.md#d#dependency-all) - Generates the dependency graphs for the PVS libraries in the current folder.

Click [here](docs/Scripts.md) for more details on these scripts.

(*) Already included in the PVS 7.1 distribution.

# Getting NASALib

## Via VSCode-PVS (recommended for new PVS users)

NASALib (v7.0.1) is fully compatible with
[VSCode-PVS](http://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs), a modern graphical
interface to PVS based on
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The latest
version of NASALib can be installed from VSCode-PVS.

## Development Version

For PVS advanced users, the development version is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/pvslib). 
To clone the development version, type the following command inside directory where PVS 7.0 is installed. Henceforth, that directory will be referred to as `<pvsdir>`. In the following commands, the dollar sign 
represents the prompt of the operating system.

```shell
$ git clone http://github.com/nasa/pvslib nasalib 
```

The command above will put a copy of the library in the directory `<pvsdir>/nasalib`.

### Major Recent Changes

* **The library `groups` is now deprecated**. The `group` library was [integrated into `algebra`](../../commit/b48b961e205f2294883c85cddc271e42610204d7) . A symbolic link is still provided for backward compatibility, but its use is discouraged. Every mention to `groups` should be replaced by `algebra`.

* **The library `trig_fnd` is now deprecated**. It's still provided for backward compatibility, but it should be replaced by `trig`.  The new library `trig`, which used to be axiomatic, is now foundational. However, in contrast to `trig_fnd`, trigonometric definitions are based on infinite series, rather than integrals. This change considerably reduces the type-checking of theories involving trigonometric functions. The change from `trig_fnd` to `trig` should not have a major impact in your formal developments since names of definitions and lemmas are the same. However, theory importing may be slightly different.

* The PVS developments `TCASII`, `WellClear`,  and `DAIDALUS` are now [available](https://github.com/nasa/WellClear/tree/master/PVS) as part of the [GitHub WellClear distribution](https://github.com/nasa/WellClear). The PVS development `PRECiSA`  is now [available](https://github.com/nasa/PRECiSA/tree/master/PVS) as part of the [GitHub PRECiSA distribution](https://github.com/nasa/PRECiSA). The PVS development `PolyCARP`  is now [available](https://github.com/nasa/PolyCARP/tree/master/PVS) as part of the [GitHub PolyCARP distribution](https://github.com/nasa/PolyCARP).


# Manual Installation

The following instructions assume that NASALib is located in the directory `<pvsdir>/nasalib`.

## 1) Add this directory to the environment variable `PVS_LIBRARY_PATH`

If it does not exists, creates such variable and with the path of this directory as only content. It is usually very useful to have your shell systems creating this variable at startup. To this end, and depending upon your shell, you may want to add one of the following lines in your startup script.  For C shell (csh or tcsh), you may add this line in `~/.cshrc`:
```shell
setenv PVS_LIBRARY_PATH "<pvsdir>/nasalib"
```
For Borne shell (bash or sh), add this line in either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:
```shell
export PVS_LIBRARY_PATH="<pvsdir>/nasalib"
```

## 2) Additional steps to protect previous NASALib configurations (optional)

If you had a previous installation of NASALib, either remove the file `~/.pvs.lisp` or, if you have a special configuration in that file, remove the following line  
```lisp
(load "<pvsdir>/nasalib/pvs-patches.lisp") 
```
## 3) Install Scripts

Finally, go to the directory `<pvsdir>/nasalib` and run the following shell scripts (the dollar sign represents the prompt of the operating system).

The `install-scripts` command will update and install NASALib scripts as needed.
~~~shell
$ ./install-scripts
~~~
