# Bernstein

This library provides a formalization of an efficient representation of multivariate Bernstein polynomials. 
It includes formally verified algorithms for finding lower and upper bounds of the minimum and maximum values of a polynomial. 
The algorithms are used in the definition of automated proof strategies for solving polynomial global optimization problems such as:
- Formally checking universally quantified multivariate polynomial inequalities on closed ranges.
- Finding witnesses that formally prove existentially quantified multivariate polynomial inequalities on open and closed ranges.
- Computing boxes (hyper-rectangles) that correctly under and over approximate regions defined as conjunction or disjunctions of multivariate polynomial inequalities.

### Strategies

### `bernstein`: Proves polynomial inequalities

#### Syntax

`(bernstein (&optional (fnum 1) vars (depth 100) vardir (equiv? t) (name "Pb__"))`

#### Description

Proves polynomial inequality `fnum` using Bernstein's basis on `vars` for `depth` levels of recursion.
The option `vardir` is an heuristic for selecting variables and direction when subdividing the range of the variables, e.g., `a2l__MaxVarMinDir`, `a2l__MaxVarMaxDir`, `a2l__AltVarLeftRight`, `a2l__AltVarRightLeft` (see theory in `Bernstein/vardirselector.pvs`).
If `vardir` is `nil`, an appropriate method is automatically selected. 
If `equiv?` is `nil`, the strategy does not try to prove the equivalence between the original polynomial and its Bernstein representation.

### Grizzly

The directory Grizzly contains a prototype client-server tool for solving global optimization problems.
Grizzly is a prototype client-server interface to PVS that solves global optimization problems such as finding min/max values of polynomials, formally verifying polynomial inequalities, solving satisfiability of polynomial inequalities, and computing under/over-approximations of regions defined by conjunction/disjunction/implication of polynomial inequalities.
For details see https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/pvs/Bernstein/Grizzly.html.

### Examples

The following examples are automatically proved in PVS using the strategy (`bernstein`), which is included in the Bernstein library.
```
  FORALL (x,y:real):
      -0.5 <= x AND x <= 1 AND -2 <= y AND y <= 1 IMPLIES 
      4*x^2 - (21/10)*x^4 + (1/3)*x^6 + (x-3)*y - 4*y^2 + 4*y^4 > -3.4
  EXISTS (x,y:real):
      -0.5 <= x AND x <= 1 AND -2 <= y AND y <= 1 AND
      4*x^2 - (21/10)*x^4 + (1/3)*x^6 + (x-3)*y - 4*y^2 + 4*y^4 < -3.39
```

More challenging problems are also included in `Bernstein@examples`.
