%% This theory states several properties of finite sequences over a non interpreted type T 
%% converted into sets through the PVS prelude conversions "seq2set" and set2seq".  
%% The ideia is essentially to simplify proofs over sequences through application of the 
%% standard properties of sets, that are available in the PVS prelude. This theory is 
%% applied in order to simplify proofs of the theorem of confluence of orthogonal TRSs 
%% that was specified using finite sequences. In particular, one step of parallel rewriting 
%% is specified in the theory orthogonality through sequences of positions, rules and
%% substitutions, which results in an analysis of parallel forks (used to prove the 
%% Parallel Moves Lemma) that is based on results related with properties of these 
%% sequences. Thus, converting these sequences into sets, standard properties of sets
%% are used, what makes the analysis simpler.
