% Defines "div" according to the Ada Reference Manual
%
%  div                 -- Ada Reference Manual division theory
%  rem                 -- Ada Reference Manual rem theory
%
% This div truncates toward zero on a negative argument.
%
% Version 1.2 Changed mod to mod_ in PVS4.0 because PVS no longer allows you to 
%             redefine a theory defined in the prelude.
% Version 1.3 Changed "divides" to "divides?" so as to not conflict with
%             prelude definition
% Version 1.4 Moved all of number_theory library to ints library
%
% NOTE: The old approach of having two different definitions of "div"
%       and "mod" defined in different theories is no longer reasonable
%       given that "mod" is now defined in the prelude.  The alternate
%       definitions are now named "tdiv" and "tmod"
% 
% NOTE: mod_ has been removed since it is now in prelude.  The additional lemmas
%       not in prelude are now in mod_lems
% 
%
% Version 1.5  product operator theories added

%%           Since int is a subtype of reals these are really just special
%%           cases of the theories in the reals library.  However, there is
%%           a bug in the PVS judgments system that makes these still useful
%%           As soon as that bug is fixed, these will be removed.
