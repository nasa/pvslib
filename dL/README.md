# Differential Dynamic Logic

This library contains an operational embedding of differential dynamic logic for the formal verification of hybrid systems. 
Hybrid systems contain continuously evolving and discretely evolving components, and arise in many safety- and mission-critical applications.
Differential dynamic logic (dL) is a framework for formally specifying and reasoning about hybrid programs, where the specification allows modeling of hybrid systems, and its proof calculus allows for reasoning about such potentially complex programs. 
This embedding of dL is operational, meaning that it leverages the internal logic of PVS, resulting in a version of dL whose proof calculus is not only formally verified, but is also executable within PVS itself. The result is a **P**roper**l**y **A**ssured **I**mplementation of **D**ifferential Dynamic Logic for H**y**brid **P**rogram **V**erification and **S**pecification, **Plaidypvs**.
