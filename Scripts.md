# Scripts

The NASALib also provides a collection of scripts that automates several tasks.

* [`proveit`](#proveit) - Runs PVS in batch mode
* [`provethem`](#provethem) - Runs `proveit` on several libraries 
* [`pvsio`](#pvsio) - Command-line utility to run the PVSio ground evaluator.
* [`prove-all`](#prove-all) - Runs `proveit` on each library in the NASALib by wrapping `provethem` in order to provide a specific kind of run. 
* [`cleanbin-all`](#cleanbin-all) - Clean `.pvscontext` and binary files from PVS libraries.
* [`find-all`](#find-all) - Searches strings matching a given regular expressions in PVS libraries.
* [`dependencygraph`](#dependencygraph) - Generates a library dependency graph for libraries in the current directory.
* [`dependency-all`](#dependency-all) - Generates the dependency graphs for the PVS libraries in the current folder.

# `proveit`

Runs PVS in batch mode

## Synopsis

```shell
proveit [ <option> ... ] [ <file>[.pvs] | [<ctxt>]@<thf1>,..,<thfn> ... | <dir> ]
```
where `<thfi>` has the form  `<th>[.<f1>:..:<fm>]`

## Typical Usage
Prove all theories in the input files, e.g.,
 
 * To prove all theories imported in `<dir>/top.pvs`, use
 ```shell
$ proveit <dir>
```

* To prove all theories in `<file>.pvs`, use
```shell
$ proveit <file>.pvs
```

* To prove all theories in `<file>.pvs` and their dependencies, use
```shell
$ proveit -a <file>.pvs
```

## Advanced Usage
In the more general form, a context, a list of theories, and a list of formulas are specified using the syntax `<[ctxt]@thf1,..,thfn>`,  where `<ctxt>` is a directory and each `<thfi>` has the form `<th[.f1:..:fm]>` with `<th>` being a theory and `<f1:..:fn>` a list of formulas in `<th>`.
Only formulas specified this way are proven by PVS. 
In this case, the proof status is saved in `<th.f1:..:fm>.summary` in `<ctxt>`. 

For example, to prove formulas `<f1>` and `<f2>` in theory `<theory>` in the current context, type: 

```shell
$ proveit @<theory>.<f1>:<f2>
```

Note that, when the target is a directory (as in the first example in the Typical Usage section), all the files in its ``pvsbin`` subfolder are overwritten.

# `provethem`

Runs `proveit` on several libraries.

## Synopsis

```shell
provethem [--help | <option> ...] <file>
```

File `<file>` must contain an ordered list of libraries to be processed by `proveit`. 
If `<file>` is not provided, the file name `all-theories` is assumed.
Each line in `<file>` must have the form 
```
<lib> [: <proveit params>]
```
where `<lib>` is a directory name and `<proveit params>` are parameters to `proveit`. 
If `<lib>` is empty, options apply to all libraries thenceforth.

Output is saved in a text file whose default name has the form `<file><postfix>.grandtotals`.
The `<postfix>` depends on the options `-do`, `-but`, `-from`, `-to`, `-after`, and `-before` given to the script.
A different name can be specified using the option `-out`.
Unless the option `-out` is explicitly use, an output file is not created when the options `-cleanbin`, `-execute` or `-test` are given.

The PVSio input/output library is implemented via [semantic attachments](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/rushby/abstracts/attachments).

# `prove-all`

Runs `proveit` on each library in the NASALib by wrapping `provethem` in order to provide a specific kind of run. 
By default, it removes `.pvscontext` and the binary files from the `pvsbin` folder in each library directory, replaces the PVS library path by the current directory, and runs `proveit` as indicated by the `nasalib.all` file.
As a side effect, it generates the dependency and `.tptp` files as needed by each library.

To supersede this particular configuration, the same options accepted by `provethem` can be used on this script.

## Synopsis

```shell
prove-all <options>
```

# `cleanbin-all`

Clean `.pvscontext` and binary files from PVS libraries.

By default, it iterates over all the libraries which are reachable from every directory mentioned in the `PVS_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. 

A library is considered reachable in a given directory `<dir>` if it is one of its direct subfolders and: 
1) there is a text file named `all-theories` in `<dir>` and the library is mentioned there or 
2) there is no such a file in `<dir>`. 

The scope of application of `cleanbin-all` can be restricted using the options `--after`, `--before`, `--but`, `--do`, `--from`, and `--to` detailed below.
The order implicitly referred to by all these options is the one induced by the applicable `all-theories` file or the default order imposed by the operating system, when no `all-theories` file exists in the directory.

## Synopsis

```shell
cleanbin-all <options>
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`--bin` | remove `.pvscontext` and binary files (**default**). |
|`--all` | remove `.pvscontext` and all files in the `pvsbin` folders. |
|`--clearpath` | clean the libraries in the current path only |
|`--addpath` | clean over `PVS_LIBRARY_PATH` and the current path |

|`--before=<dir>` | prove all libraries before `<dir>`, exclusive |
|`--but=<dir1>,..,<dirn>` | do not process libraries `<dir1>,...,<dirn>` |

|`--from=<dir>` | prove all libraries from `<dir>`, inclusive. |
|`--to=<dir>` | prove all libraries to `<dir>`, inclusive. |
|`-h \| --help` | print help message |
|`--version` | print version information and exit |

# `find-all`

Searches strings matching a given regular expressions in PVS libraries.

## Synopsis

```shell
find-all [--help | <option>* ] <regexpr>
```

## Description 

By default, it finds in all the libraries which are reachable from the current directory. 

A library is considered reachable in a given directory `<dir>` if it is one of its direct subfolders and there is a text file named all-theories in `<dir>` and the library is mentioned there.
The scope of application of `find-all` can be restricted using the options `--after`, `--before`, `--but`, `--do`, `--from`, and `--to` detailed below.
The order implicitly referred to by all these options is the one induced by the applicable `all-theories` file.

## Description 

This script builds a dot graph of library dependencies. 

If `<file>` is not provided, the file name all-theories is assumed.
Particular libraries in `<file>` can be selected using the options: `--do`, `--after`, `--before`, `--from`, `--to`. The option `--but` unselect a list of developments.

If `<outfile>` is not specified, `<file><postfix>` is used. The `<postfix>` depends on library selection option, i.e., `--do`,`--but`,`--from`,`--to`,`--after`,`--before`,`--zoom`.
DependencyGraph depends on Graphviz's dot utility to produce a pdf or SVG output.
  
When the option `--zoom` is used, the specified developments are zoomed such that the each theory in those developments in represented by a node in the dependency graph.
  
The `--reach-from=<lib>@<th>` option allows to print only the theories which are reachable from `<lib>@<th>`.
Note, also, that `<lib>` will be added to the visible scope if not already part of it.
Additionally, DependencyGraph will zoom into `<lib>` as if it were mentioned in the `--zoom` option.
Theories from other libraries are explicitly mentioned in the resulting graph only if they belong to a zoomed library, otherwise only the referenced library is mentioned.

# `dependency-all`

## Description
Uses `provethem` to iterate dependency-graph over all the libraries in the current directory. 

As in `provethem`, the scope of application of dependency-all can be controlled using the options --after, --before, --but, --do, --from, and --to detailed below. The order implicitly referred to by all these options is the one induced by the applicable `all-theories` file.
